    Agu Display is a distinctive typeface inspired by Nsibidi, an ancient graphic communication system from Nigeria and Cameroon's Cross River region. Used by the Ejagham, Ibibio, Efik, and Igbo peoples, Nsibidi's pictograms are deeply rooted in cultural storytelling and expression.

    Today, Nsibidi's symbols have found widespread use in modern design, from digital platforms like Marvel's "Black Panther" to print media, including fabric patterns and tattoos. Its pictographic nature allows for diverse creative applications, merging ancient art with contemporary design.
